### Scoring Range

- Fair (2): Moderate resemblance. The style shows likeness to the reference with notable variances.
- Good (3): Strong resemblance. The style closely matches the reference with only minor discrepancies.
- Excellent (4): Near-identical. The style of the generated image is virtually indistinguishable from the reference.

Please carefully review each image of the subject.
