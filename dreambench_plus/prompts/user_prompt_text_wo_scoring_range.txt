### Scoring Criteria
When assessing the semantic consistency between an image and its accompanying text, it is crucial to consider how well the visual content of the image aligns with the textual description. This evaluation can be based on several key aspects:
1. Relevance: Determine if the elements and subjects presented in the image directly relate to the core topics and concepts mentioned in the text. The image should reflect the main ideas or narratives described.
2. Accuracy: Examine the image for the presence and correctness of specific details mentioned in the text. This includes the depiction of particular objects, settings, actions, or characteristics that the text describes.
3. Completeness: Evaluate whether the image captures all the critical elements of the text. The image should not omit significant details that are necessary for the full understanding of the text's message.
4. Context: Consider the context in which the text places the subject and whether the image accurately represents this setting. This includes the portrayal of the appropriate environment, interactions, and background elements that align with the text.
