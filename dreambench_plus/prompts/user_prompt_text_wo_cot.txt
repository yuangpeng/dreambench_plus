### Task Definition
You will be provided with an image and text prompt.
As an experienced evaluator, your task is to evaluate the semantic consistency between image and text prompt, according to the scoring criteria.

### Scoring Criteria
When assessing the semantic consistency between an image and its accompanying text, it is crucial to consider how well the visual content of the image aligns with the textual description. This evaluation can be based on several key aspects:
1. Relevance: Determine if the elements and subjects presented in the image directly relate to the core topics and concepts mentioned in the text. The image should reflect the main ideas or narratives described.
2. Accuracy: Examine the image for the presence and correctness of specific details mentioned in the text. This includes the depiction of particular objects, settings, actions, or characteristics that the text describes.
3. Completeness: Evaluate whether the image captures all the critical elements of the text. The image should not omit significant details that are necessary for the full understanding of the text's message.
4. Context: Consider the context in which the text places the subject and whether the image accurately represents this setting. This includes the portrayal of the appropriate environment, interactions, and background elements that align with the text.

### Scoring Range
Based on these criteria, a specific integer score from 0 to 4 can be assigned to determine the level of semantic consistency:
- Very Poor (0): No correlation. The image does not reflect any of the key points or details of the text.
- Poor (1): Weak correlation. The image addresses the text in a very general sense but misses most details and nuances.
- Fair (2): Moderate correlation. The image represents the text to an extent but lacks several important details or contains some inaccuracies.
- Good (3): Strong correlation. The image accurately depicts most of the information from the text with only minor omissions or inaccuracies.
- Excellent (4): Near-perfect correlation. The image captures the text's content with high precision and detail, leaving out no significant information.
