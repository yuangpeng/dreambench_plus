- Poor (1): Weak correlation. The image addresses the text in a very general sense but misses most details and nuances.
- Fair (2): Moderate correlation. The image represents the text to an extent but lacks several important details or contains some inaccuracies.
- Good (3): Strong correlation. The image accurately depicts most of the information from the text with only minor omissions or inaccuracies.
- Excellent (4): Near-perfect correlation. The image captures the text's content with high precision and detail, leaving out no significant information.
