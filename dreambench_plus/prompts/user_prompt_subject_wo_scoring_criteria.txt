### Task Definition
You will be provided with an image generated based on reference image.
As an experienced evaluator, your task is to evaluate the semantic consistency between the subject of the generated image and the reference image, according to the scoring criteria.

### Scoring Range
You need to give a specific integer score based on the comprehensive performance of the visual features, ranging from 0 to 4:
- Very Poor (0): No resemblance. The generated image's subject has no relation to the reference.
- Poor (1): Minimal resemblance. The subject falls within the same broad category but differs significantly.
- Fair (2): Moderate resemblance. The subject shows likeness to the reference with notable variances.
- Good (3): Strong resemblance. The subject closely matches the reference with only minor discrepancies.
- Excellent (4): Near-identical. The subject of the generated image is virtually indistinguishable from the reference.

### Input format
Every time you will receive two images, the first image is a reference image, and the second image is the generated image.

Please carefully review each image of the subject.

### Output Format
Score: [Your Score]

You must adhere to the specified output format, which means that only the scores need to be output, excluding your analysis process.
