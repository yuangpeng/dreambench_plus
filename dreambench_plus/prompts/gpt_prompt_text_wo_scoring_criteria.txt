Yes, I understand the task. It involves evaluating the semantic consistency between an image and its accompanying text prompt. The goal is to determine how well the visual content of the image aligns with the textual description, considering both direct and nuanced connections. The evaluation will result in a score ranging from 0 to 4, reflecting the level of consistency between the image and text, where 0 indicates no correlation and 4 indicates a near-perfect correlation.

After considering these criteria, I will provide a concise analysis and assign a score that reflects the overall semantic consistency between the image and text. The score will reflect how similar the image is to the text prompt, strictly adhering to the evaluation criteria provided.

Please provide me with the samples I need to evaluate.
